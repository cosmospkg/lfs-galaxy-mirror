# 🌌 LFS Galaxy for Cosmos

> A cosmic work-in-progress. This Galaxy currently contains no Stars, but it dreams of bootstrapping a full LFS system. Until then, it floats silently in the void.

---

## 🛠️ What This Is

- A stubbed-out Galaxy directory for Cosmos
- Includes a valid `meta.toml` and a sense of potential
- Ready for contributors to start building Stars
- Intended to eventually replace the LFS book with `cosmos install`

## 📂 Current Contents

```txt

├── meta.toml          # The map of the void
├── packages/          # Empty, for now
└── stars/             # Waiting for light
```

---

## 🚧 Current Status

- No Stars exist yet
- `meta.toml` is real, and that’s about it
- The `core-stack` Star will be added once there’s anything to stack

---

## 🧠 Contributing

Want to help populate the stars?
- Fork this repo
- Create a new Star using `stellar`
- Add your `.toml` to `stars/`, and `.tar.gz` to `packages/`
- Update `meta.toml` accordingly

You’ll be the first light in the void.
